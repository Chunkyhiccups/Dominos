**When reporting an issue, please try to reproduce the issue with just Dominos and Dominos_Config running.** Dominos reuses a good chunk of the stock UI, and other popular addons, like Move Anything, like to take control of those parts, too.

**Addon Version**
You can get this via running `/dominos version` in game

**World of Warcraft Version**
For example, Classic, Retail, PTR, Beta.
