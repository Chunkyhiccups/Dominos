h2. Using LibDataBroker-1.1

h3. Embedding the library

LibDataBroker is designed to be embedded into the addons that use it.
The user should never have to worry about what version of the library they have, or even really be aware of the library's existence.

Embedding the library is a fairly simple task.  Simply include LibDataBroker-1.1.lua in your addon's files and add it into your TOC to be loaded.
Make sure that you include "LibStub":http://www.wowwiki.com/LibStub and "CallbackHandler-1.0":http://www.wowace.com/wiki/CallbackHandler-1.0 as well, and that they load before LDB.
If you use Ace3 in your addon, you probably already have LibStub and CallbackHandler, just make sure they're loaded before LDB.

h3. Providing a dataobject

Before anyone can do anything, we need some data to display.
For our first example, we'll provide a static dataobject that is simply declared on load and never changed after that.
This implements the "Quicklauncher" spec below to create a button to open our config panel.

<pre>
LibStub:GetLibrary("LibDataBroker-1.1"):NewDataObject("MyAddonName", {
	launcher = true,
	icon = "Interface\\Icons\\Spell_Nature_StormReach",
	OnClick = function(clickedframe, button) InterfaceOptionsFrame_OpenToFrame(myconfigframe) end,
})
</pre>

Pretty simple eh?  Now why don't we make a dataobject that implements the "data display" spec.
This data can be used by a display addon to create an always-up frame, like a FuBar plugin would.

<pre>
local UPDATEPERIOD, elapsed = 0.5, 0
local dataobj = LibStub:GetLibrary("LibDataBroker-1.1"):NewDataObject("myFPS", {text = "75.0 FPS"})
local f = CreateFrame("frame")

f:SetScript("OnUpdate", function(self, elap)
	elapsed = elapsed + elap
	if elapsed < UPDATEPERIOD then return end

	elapsed = 0
	local fps = GetFramerate()
	dataobj.text = string_format("%.1f FPS", fps)
end)

function dataobj.OnEnter(self)
	GameTooltip:SetOwner(self, "ANCHOR_NONE")
	GameTooltip:SetPoint("TOPLEFT", self, "BOTTOMLEFT")
	GameTooltip:ClearLines()
	GameTooltip:AddLine("myFPS")
	GameTooltip:Show()
end

function dataobj.OnLeave()
	GameTooltip:Hide()
end
</pre>

Here our dataobject gets updated every half-second with the current FPS.
We also provide OnEnter and OnLeave script handlers.
If the display addon chooses to attach these to the frame it uses for our data, the user will get a tooltip when they hover over that frame.

h2. Data Specifications

Provided below are two suggested data specs.
These specs are very open to modification and enhancement by display addons, but plugins providing data should not expect that anything except the required fields are supported in the display.

h3. Data Display

Data display addons provide a LDB "feed" for an always-up addon to display.
These addons can be thought of like RSS feeds, where the display addon is similar to an RSS reader.
Display addons could include FuBar, Titan Panel, StatBlocks, LegoBlocks, or any other design out there.

h4. Fields

|_. text _Required_ | The text to be shown. |
|_. label | A title for your feed, often shown to the left of the text, user might choose to hide this. |
|_. icon | Full path to a texture, often shown to the left of the label or text. |
|_. OnClick | An OnClick script handler to be directly attached to the display frame.  Receives the usual args an OnClick receives (self, button). |
|_. tooltiptext | A string for the display addon to pass directly to GameTooltip:SetText() when a tooltip is needed. |
|_. OnTooltipShow | A function to call when the display wants to show a tooltip.  The display will manage positioning, clearing and showing the tooltip, all this handler needs to do is populate the tooltip using :AddLine or similar.  The display should pass the tooltip to this callback, in case it isn't using GameTooltip. |
|_. OnEnter | An OnEnter script handler to be directly attached to the display frame.  Usually used to display a tooltip.  This handler should check the position of the frame it is passed and anchor the tolltip to that frame accordingly. |
|_. OnLeave | An OnLeave script handler to be directly attached to the display frame.  Usually used to hide the toolip. |
|_. tooltip | A frame to be displayed when the display frame is entered.  The display addon is responsible for anchoring, showing and hiding this frame as needed.  The tooltip frame's OnShow can be used to refresh the frame.  Note that this frame doesn't have to be a GameTooltip. |

h3. Quicklauncher

A quicklauncher is a LDB object that does not provide any data, but instead provides an OnClick handler to allow fast access to config panels, toggle settings, or perform other actions.

<em> Quicklaunchers should never expect a secure frame to be used, therefore actions like spellcasting are not possible. </em>

h4. Fields

|_. launcher _Required_ | Set to true, indicates that this data object is a launcher and does not provide any data to be rendered in an always-up frame. |
|_. icon _Required_ | Full path to a texture for display. |
|_. OnClick _Required_ | An OnClick script handler to be directly attached to the display frame.  Receives the usual args an OnClick receives (self, button). |
|_. tocname | The name of the addon providing the launcher, if it's name does not match the dataobject's name.  Used by displays to get TOC metadata about the addon. |
|_. label | A label to use for the launcher, overriding the dataobject name. |
